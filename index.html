<h1>Installation Instructions for Adobe Indesign/Photoshop CS6</h1>

<p>Since we are using a cracked version of Indesign and Photoshop, during installation <strong>there must be no internet connection</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not install Photoshop and Indesign at the same time. First install either of these and then the other. This guide is for both Photoshop and Indesign.</p>

<p>For those of you using Photoshop/Indesign CC version, the steps are similar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>First step is to start the installation.</p>

<p><img src="setup.jpg" alt="Set-up.exe" title="" /></p>

<p>I currently do not have Windows, so I cannot post screenshots of actual installation. But the installation process is straight-forward.</p>

<p>Since you have already disconnected the internet, run the Set-up.exe file as shown above.</p></li>
<li><p>Soon you will see this window. Click on the "Try" option (marked with a red rectangle).</p>

<p><img src="try.png" alt="Click on Try" title="" /></p>

<p>After this step, there is nothing else to do except clicking next, next and so on. <strong>DO NOT</strong> touch any other options, just let them be.</p>

<p>After the installation completes, close the installer. <strong>DO NOT</strong> connect to the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the app (Indesign or Photoshop) once, and then close it. This is important, you have to run  the app once in trial mode.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cracking</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Now comes the fun (cracking) part. This is somewhat peculiar step so watch closely. (I think this is the thing that was bugging you for days).</p></li>
<li><p>Open the folder where the cracked DLL files are (must be named either 'Cracked DLL' or 'DLL FILES')</p>

<p><img src="crackdown.jpg" alt="Crackdown" title="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the folders named Original-32bit and Original-64bit for now. That file marked IMPORTANT.txt is also not so important.</p></li>
<li><p>The two folders 32-bit and 64-bit each have a file known as <strong>amtlib.dll</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of you are using 64-bit Windows. Open the C: drive. (If you use a 32-bit version of Windows, you only have to care about the 32-bit folder).</p></li>
<li><p>There are two folders - "Program Files" and "Program Files (x86)".</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"Program Files" store 64-bit software, each and every file in this folder is for 64-bit systems.</p></li>
<li><p>"Program Files (x86)" store 32-bit software files.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>For Indesign CS6</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Now, the amtlib.dll from "32-bit" folder must go into the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe InDesign CS6.</p></li>
<li><p>And, the amtlib.dll file from "64-bit" folder must go into C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Media Encoder CS6</p></li>
<li><p>Windows will ask you to overwrite, just do it.  </p></li>
</ul>

<h4>For Photoshop CS6</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Be Careful, <strong>DO NOT</strong> copy amtlib.dll from Indesign folder, use the one provided by Photoshop.</p></li>
<li><p>The Photoshop installation folder has similar "32-bit" and "64-bit" folders in "Cracked DLL" folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy 64-bit amtlib.dll into C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6</p></li>
<li><p>Copy 32-bit amtlib.dll into C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6</p></li>
<li><p>There is an extra step for Photoshop, there is a folder known as Official<em>Update</em>Patch which contains AdobePatchInstaller.exe. After the cracking step, just run it. (This will simply update Photoshop).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now you can connect to the Internet. Start Photoshop / Indesign.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not a fool-proof method, someday Adobe might discover that you are using cracked software and so the software may pop-up an error message.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it will work flawlessly in the University, because it cannot connect through proxy.</p></li>
</ul>
